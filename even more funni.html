<meta name="description" content="Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a psycho-social intervention[1][2] that aims to reduce symptoms of various mental health conditions, primarily depression and anxiety disorders.[3] CBT focuses on challenging and changing cognitive distortions (such as thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes) and their associated behaviors to improve emotional regulation[2][4] and develop personal coping strategies that target solving current problems. Though it was originally designed to treat depression, its uses have been expanded to include the treatment of many mental health conditions, including anxiety,[5][6] substance use disorders, marital problems, and eating disorders.[7][8][9] CBT includes a number of cognitive or behavioral psychotherapies that treat defined psychopathologies using evidence-based techniques and strategies.[10][11][12]

CBT is a common form of talk therapy based on the combination of the basic principles from behavioral and cognitive psychology.[2] It is different from historical approaches to psychotherapy, such as the psychoanalytic approach where the therapist looks for the unconscious meaning behind the behaviors, and then formulates a diagnosis. Instead, CBT is a "problem-focused" and "action-oriented" form of therapy, meaning it is used to treat specific problems related to a diagnosed mental disorder. The therapist's role is to assist the client in finding and practicing effective strategies to address the identified goals and to alleviate symptoms of the disorder.[13] CBT is based on the belief that thought distortions and maladaptive behaviors play a role in the development and maintenance of many psychological disorders[3] and that symptoms and associated distress can be reduced by teaching new information-processing skills and coping mechanisms.[1][13][14]

When compared to psychoactive medications, review studies have found CBT alone to be as effective for treating less severe forms of depression,[15] anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), tics,[16] substance use disorders, eating disorders, and borderline personality disorder.[17] Some research suggests that CBT is most effective when combined with medication for treating mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder.[18] CBT is recommended as the first line of treatment for the majority of psychological disorders in children and adolescents, including aggression and conduct disorder.[1][4] Researchers have found that other bona fide therapeutic interventions were equally effective for treating certain conditions in adults.[19][20] Along with interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), CBT is recommended in treatment guidelines as a psychosocial treatment of choice">

<p>My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a Virtual Youtuber empire for over a year now and using me as his recruiter. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my Live2D knowledge to recruit talents, which he would then hire using his connections in the Japanese utaite world. Connections that he made through his career with Niconico. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small indie channel could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Motoaki "Yagoo" Tanigo, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Yagoo threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Yagoo had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Yagoo flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Yagoo was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a "hit" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Riku Tazumi , he plotted to kill Yagoo, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Cover Corp, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my vtubing activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.</p>

<p>I think about her everyday, I don't care about any other women just her. And quite frankly I only masturbate to her as well. She's all I need.</p>
<p>I'm guessing I finally snapped and my brain made her a replacement for a girlfriend, what do I do? I don't know how to meet real women.</p>

<p>i love astolfo</p>
<p>Astolfo is so cute I want him to sit on my face and afterword we snuggle and kiss. The next morning we would go shopping and buy new skirts in Costco and maybe stop in the dairy aisle for special cream and make some in the restroom while we hold each other closely and make each other cum UwU. when we get home we will make donaries with special sauce while we jerk each other off, and after we play together we will grind the German tech tree on war thunder and we will see who can launch their cum the farthest. At night we will snuggle and when we wake up we will have whipped cream with cum on our pancakes . But eventually we will have to get back tp our normal lives.</p>
<p>Before he would leave I would kiss him for the longest I have ever had before . Then he'd decide to propose to me after we kiss . when we got married we decided to adopt kids and we'd make them have feminine clothes while we'd brush their hair. one time while we were doing the dirty to each other Jamal (our oldest child) walked in so we decided to teach him how kids were made and he would learn he had two dads but sadly we would both pass away at the age 87 but we had sex for the most of it.</p>

<p>I can cum just by tensing my asshole</p>
<p>So the other day I made a discovery so miraculous Christopher Columbus would've tried to colonise it. I was getting down to some me time, as we all do, however I found that after loading my video of choice and doing one stroke that I already felt right on the edge, because I didn't want to finish so early into my session I let go to let the sensation settle down, to my dismay I found that I was still feeling really close nearly a minute or two later. At this point I'm really confused, because I have stroked myself once and let myself rest for two minutes and it still feels like I've been jerking it the whole time. This is when curiosity strikes, I thought to myself "can I finish myself with no hands?" Now for the people who don't know, men can make themselves feel more pleasure and sensitivity by tensing their legs and butt, in a sudden burst of the weirdest mix of horny curiosity and determination I tensed my butt in just the right away over the span of a minute and I was so shocked when it actually fucking worked, I just made myself cum with tensing and willpower, this was ground breaking. I have now found I have the ability to do this without even using my hands in the first place and I'm not sure if I'm God or his biggest mistake.</p>

<p>You want to know why I love dat boi? Dat boi is a completely self-made meme. So many other memes are based in nostalgic childrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not dat boi. Dat boi is completely absurd. It's a low-res frog on a unicycle, and an arbitrary method for greeting him. The first person to ever upvote dat boi did not do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote dat boi did not do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote dat boi upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Dat boi is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote dat boi, o shit waddup!</p>

What a lot of us don't realize🤡, however, is that cucklord🤢 Chris was an even sussier🤔 baka🤮 than we thought💭. About 5️⃣ centuries prior, a naughty😈 Nord🚣‍♂️ by the name of Leif🍃 Erikson☀️ had already set foot🦶 on the North⬆️ American🌎 continent. Our lecherously😵‍💫 libidinous😛 Leify boi was on his way to Greenland🇬🇱 when he got blown👄🌭 off course to land in the greatest country on earth🗺: that's right, Canada🇨🇦!!1! Now, every president since Lyndong🍌 B. Johnson🌽 has recognized lascivious😳 Leif🍁, and you should too. Make sure you celebrate🎉 the true spirit👻 of today📆 by getting colonized in the ass🍑 by a voluminous🤤 viking!! Share this with 1️⃣3️⃣ historical hoebuckets🪣 who are horny👹 for nutty🥒💦 Nords. You'd better hope you get at least 🔟 back, or else instead of a sensual🥵 sexplorer❤️‍🔥, you'll be nothing but a Santa🎅 Maria sleazebag‼️</p>

<p>In today's Roblox economy, this isn't much a surprise really. 100 robux is like the equivalent of a dollar and it's pretty common knowledge. You should also note that the Roblox economy - although virtual - is just like a real life economy. The value of robux can fluctuate based on capitalist values - users can decide the price of their products and that could completely change the value of Robux. A great example of this are the items that were sold in the early 2010s compared to items sold today. The average hat on Roblox, before UGC, back in 2014 would be about 15-20 robux, which is around .5 to a dollar then. If you look at an average hat today - which is a UGC item - that item would cost 50-100 robux, which is also still about a dollar. Not only are the economic decisions of the user are a major factor in the virtual economy, but also real life economic fluctuations as well. Even if the robux economy was well maintained, it can not avoid the fluctuations of the US Dollar or other real-life currencies. 100 robux, may seem a lot, but that's the reality of economics. I mean, I personally agree it's a lot, and I mostly blame the Roblox community for being the leading problem in that. Destroying the economy due to their greed and inexperience.</p>

<p>So one of my friends has been single for a month and he's been feeling depressed cos of it, he's always complaining about not getting his dick sucked so I unzipped his pants and ended the complaining right then and there, I didn't take any pleasure from it, apart from cheering my friend up of course, but I can't help feeling what I did was gay</p>
<p></p>
<p>I want to be the sex slave of an upper class white man in his twenties/early thirties with anger management issues that forces me to wear a maid outfit (or any girly clothes in general) and tells me that i am his, and only his cute little slut while he ravages my butt with his cock and makes me eat my own cum afterwardsCopied!</p>
